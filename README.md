# Computational-Theory

This is my repository for Computational Theory project in 4th Year in Software Development at ATU. This project was created in Jupyter Notebook.

Files contained are: 

## project.ipynb

This contains the full project on the numbers game, Countdown. This includes information on the actual game and algorithms for solving the problem by generating random numbers and finding the expressions that solve for the randomly generated target number.

## results.txt

This is used to save all the correct expressions found due the possiblity of being many expressions.
