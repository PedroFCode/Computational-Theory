    "<h5>Countdown is a numbers game whereby contestants are given a selection of numbers and a target number. Using only basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), the contestants must try to reach the target number using only the chosen numbers. This project, done in a Jupyter Notebook, explains the game in detail and contains python code of the game being completed by solve_numbers function. The goal is to have a working version of the countdown game."
