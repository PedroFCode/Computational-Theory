    "<h5>Countdown is a numbers game whereby contestants are given a selection of numbers and a target number. Using only basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), the contestants must try to reach the target number using only the chosen numbers. This project, done in a Jupyter Notebook, explains the game in detail and contains python code of the game being completed by solve_numbers function. The goal is to have a working version of the countdown game."

    "How the game works: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Players are given a selection of six numbers, usually a mix of small numbers (1-10) and large numbers (25, 50, 75, or 100).\n",
    "\n",
    "- A three-digit target number is randomly generated. Generally starts at 101 to 999. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Players have to use some or all of the six numbers (using each number once and only once) to reach the target number exactly, or as close as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- They can use any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to manipulate the numbers. However at no point can the number be a fraction or decimal. Subtraction may only be used if the result is a positive number.\n"

    "Although the algorithm below doesn't use this formula directly, it does have many similarities. This is similar to selecting a subset of numbers from a larger set, which is essentially what combinations represent in combinatorics.\n",

    "- Combination of Numbers: Generates all combinations of numbers from the list. This is similar to selecting a subset of numbers from a larger set, which is essentially what combinations represent in combinatorics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Permutations of Numbers: For each combination of numbers, it calculates the number of permutations of those numbers. This is similar to the concept of arranging items in a specific order, which is what permutations represent. In this case, the order matters because changing the order of numbers in an expression changes the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Permutations of Operators: For each combination of numbers, it also calculates the number of permutations of operators. Since there are four basic arithmetic operators and they can be repeated, the number of permutations of operators is calculated as 4ùëü‚àí1 where ùëü is the number of numbers in the combination. This is similar to the idea of selecting a subset of items from a set with replacement, which is a concept related to permutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total Count: The total number of valid expressions is calculated by multiplying the number of permutations of numbers by the number of permutations of operators for each combination of numbers. This multiplication is reminiscent of the multiplication principle in combinatorics, where the total count of outcomes is calculated by multiplying the counts of individual steps or choices."

    "Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), or postfix notation, is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands. This eliminates the need for parentheses to indicate the order of operations because the order is unambiguous.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Operand-Push Rule: When an operand is encountered, it is pushed into a stack.\n",
    "- Operator-Evaluation Rule: When an operator is encountered, it is applied to the top elements of the stack, and the result is pushed back into the stack.\n",

    "- If the token is a left parenthesis, push it onto the operator stack.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- If the token is a right parenthesis:\n",
    "- Pop operators from the stack and add them to the output until a left parenthesis is encountered. Discard the left parenthesis.\n",
